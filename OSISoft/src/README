ELEVATOR CONTROL SYSTEM : 
-------------------------

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS : 
--------------------
1. Keep all .java files, Manifest file and runElevatorControlSystem under same directory.
2. Provide executable permission to runElevatorControlSystem file.

USAGE : 
-------
./runElevatorControlSystem Elevator_Count Number_Of_Floors


POSSIBLE COMMANDS : 
-------------------
1. status : Provides status for each elevator in following format - 

   Elevator_ID	Current_Floor	Direction	Destination_Floors

2. step : Starts the Elevator System simulation. If the elevator is moving then simulates it's movement in correct
          direction. Updates current floor and destination floors list.
3. stop : Stop the simulation for elevators.
4. pickup Pickup_Floor Direction : Adds a pickup from input floor in corresponding direction. Program does best effort
   load balancing based on available elevators and nearest elevator.
5. update Elevator_ID Destination_Floor : Adds a destination floor for input elevator. Currently, I have not provided
   functionality to update current floor for an elevator. This could be easily done but would require few validations
   on new floor, direction and destination floor list's update.


POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS : 
-----------------------
1. Possible to update current floor for an elevator. This will allow updating current floor even if "step" is not
   activated. Present implementation will update current floor only when "step" is activated.
2. Load balancing could be done in better way.
3. Need to handle destination floor list in a better way. Currently, it will just store the floor number and not direction.
   Storing direction would help in following scenario - 
   Consider system has 1 elevator which is moving up with destination floors at 3, 5, 10. If user requests a pickup from
   floor 6 to go down, elevator should not stop at 6 while going up. It should reach floor 10 and then go up if the user
   at floor 10 need to. And then elevator should come to floor 6 as it needs to go down.
